# Music theory models in Scala

**WIP**
The idea is to create a basic Scala music theory library inspired by the [go-music-theory](https://github.com/go-music-theory/music-theory) 
and the [libjamu](https://github.com/francoiscabrol/libjamu).

You can look into the [tests](https://github.com/francoiscabrol/scala-music-theory/tree/master/src/test/scala/com/francoiscabrol/music/theory)
to see examples.
